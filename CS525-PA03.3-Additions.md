Work done by Stephen Kelly and Matthew Lowery

## Stephen's Work
Note that the engine being used (Tara) was developed by Stephen, entirely since the first day of this class. Some of the major structures, like the Renderer, Event, Application, and Window classes were made before this assignment. Others were created for or heavily modified during the assignment.

It should be noted that I (Stephen) am generally making things WAY harder than they need to be because I plan on continuing this engine after the end of the class.

**Engine:**
* Lua system
	* Script class to manage lua, and manage making types in lua
	* ScriptComponent class to be the C++ container for a specific script
	* Lua library system, to make extra lua code that runs at startup to load various functions and constants
	* Casting of C++ Userdata values in lua
	* Connecting Engine classes and functions to Lua
* Font rendering (Not used in game)
* Perspective Camera (Not used in game)
* Get screen-space location as ray into worldspace (ie, tell in the world where the mouse is) (Not used in game)
* Custom Vector class and its many functions, to replace the typedefed glm::vec3

**Game:**
* Exposed Game classes and functions to Lua
* Some lua debugging and polishing
* Generally forgetting to delete LOG_S calls
