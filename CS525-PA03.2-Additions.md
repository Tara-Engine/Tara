## Stephen's Work
Note that the engine being used (Tara) was developed by Stephen, entirely since the first day of this class. Some of the major structures, like the Renderer, Event, Application, and Window classes were made before this assignment. Others were created for or heavily modified during the assignment.

**Engine:**
* Batch Rendered: every call to `Renderer::Quad(...)` results in the quad being stored, then, at the end of the scene, all being drawn in 1 draw call. This allows for millions of quads to be drawn with basically no lag (as its all 1 draw call) and different texture subimages to be drawn as a quad (ie, a single frame from a spritesheet).
* Sprite Reworking: Sprites are now an asset (importing soon to be added). They contain information about the number of frames they have, in X and Y, as well as named animation ranged. SpriteEntities now hold a Sprite instead of a Texture2D, and have the current frame and the current animation, as well as the ability to change those, either directly setting the frame, setting the animation range, or, playing a named animation range. Each SpriteEntity holds this independant of the Sprite, so, two SpriteEntities can be on different frames even if they hold the same Sprite.
* Dealyed function calling: `Tara::After(...)` is a new mechanism to call a function after some N number of seconds. This is entirely managed by the engine. 
**Game:**
* RoomEntity: the RoomEntity is a simple wrapper around SpriteEntity, but with information about the permutation and doors, so that the player can tell what sort of room they are in and where they can walk.
* PlayerEntity: The Player has the ability to be given a Target and a time in which to reach that target, and they smoothly interpolate there. They also know what room they end up in, and respond appropreately (ie, dying, moving to next level, etc). They also respond to keyboard events, and contain the logic to not walk out of the rooms. Players also know if they are dead.
* RoomManager support code: Basically, everything but the `Generate(...)` function. This is mostly just some simple support code. 
* Player respawning and new Level Loading: This is really straightforward. If the player stepps in a trap, they are marked dead (allowing the dead texture to render). A second later, they are marked alive, and have their position reset to spawn (via Matthew's Respawn function - I did not make that function).  For Level Loading, it basically destroys the current game layer, and makes a whole new one. Many loaded assets are preserved by the Engine's Asset Manager system (ie, even if the Create() function for a texture is called, if the texture exists already in the Asset Manager, that existing copy is returned instead of loading a new one. This has existed for a while already)
* Layouts of some rooms


## Matthew's Work

**Game:**
* `Generate()` function: The heart of the game's randomization. This function generates a random dungeon based on the size, flow level, and trap density given. It ensures room links are bidirectional and that there is a clear path from spawn to goal.
