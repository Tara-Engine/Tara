## Stephen's Work
Note that the engine being used (Tara) was developed by Stephen, entirely since the first day of this class. Some of the major structures, like the Renderer, Event, Application, and Window classes were made before this assignment. Others were created for or heavily modified during the assignment.

**Engine:**
* Various Improvements, including:
	* Profiling
	* Improved Entity and Component creation with good compiler error messages
	* Events related to scene tree changes
	* Entity deletion
* Components! These are attached to entities to give them behavior. In the game, there is one "PawnEntity" used by both the PC and the NPC, the difference in controll only being because they each have a different component.
**Game:**
* Sprite for Player and Entity (Player was last week, forgot to add it)
* PlayerControllerComponent
* PawnEntity is able to have target and direction set
* Enemy spawning
* Player death by entity
