A lot of my knowledge about game engine design comes from [The Cherno's Youtube series on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&index=1), and I referenced some of the code I wrote following those tutorials while making this engine. Some things, (like window abstraction) are likely to be very similar, but others, like some of how I design imput and layers, will be very different.

Anything in the "Vendor" folder is third-party, and the license, if available, is in the folder of each individual part.
